Rising demand, renewable integration, and shifting consumption patterns create new challenges for India’s power sector. Reliable load forecasting is essential for maintaining grid stability and minimizing power imbalance. This project focused on developing an accurate short-term and medium-term electricity load forecasting model using SCADA (real-time) and AMR data.

Developed an electricity load forecasting model leveraging real-time and historical data.

Forecasted electricity demand at multiple horizons — 15 minutes, 1 hour, and 1 day ahead.

Results
MAPE=0.61%,R² = 0.995 on 15min horizon
MAPE=1.06%, R²= 0.986 on 1 hour horizon
