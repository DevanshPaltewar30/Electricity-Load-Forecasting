# Electricity-Load-Forecasting
Rising demand, renewable integration, and also shifting consumption patterns create new challenges for India’s
power sector. For grid stability, reliable forecasting is a critical need. Load fluctuations in addition to seasonal
variations cause the need for the Duck-curve effect. For distributors of state power, forecasting an accurate load
is important in order to reduce the effect of imbalance in the matching of electricity demand with a power
purchase. Demand increases within India’s power sector. Solar energy integrates renewables, consumption
patterns change, making the challenge difficult.
• Developed an electricity load forecasting model using SCADA (real-time) and AMR data.
• Forecasted electricity demand at multiple horizons — 15 minutes, 1 hour, and 1 day
ahead
